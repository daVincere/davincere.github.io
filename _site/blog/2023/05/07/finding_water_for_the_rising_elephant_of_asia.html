<hr>
<p>In the back of every NCERT book, there used to be a talisman on decision making by Mahatma Gandhi. It goes something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>..Whenever you are in doubt, or when the self becomes too much with you, apply the following test. Recall the face of the poorest and the weakest man [woman] whom you may have seen, and ask yourself, if the step you contemplate is going to be of any use to him [her]. Will he [she] gain anything by it? Will it restore him [her] to a control over his [her] own life and destiny? In other words, will it lead to swaraj [freedom] for the hungry and spiritually starving millions?
Then you will find your doubts and your self melt away.
<a href="https://www.mkgandhi.org/gquots1.htm">Mahatma Gandhi</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>For me, these poor would always be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFz5twF2PNg">The Patriwala from Ayodhya</a> or (the Street Vendor from Azadpur Mandi)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETL-hcD7VNE] – with such realities around you, it gets hard to play blind and work on any product that doesn’t directly (or indirectly) work towards their upliftment. <em>No hate or virtue signalling here, people should do what makes them happy and content</em></p>

<p>India is currently the 5th largest economy at $2.651 trillion GDP. We are aiming at a $5 trillion economy by 2025 and are poised to be the 3rd largest economy by 2075 – big leagues.</p>

<p>Outside of it, India is the biggest, youngest open market in the world. A lot of problems still exist – someone will fulfill all those needs, in all aspects of life and make a killing. You will see more companies coming in, more FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) and more companies growing up. The dream of our freedom fighters – to build everything from a needle to a rocket – in our country.</p>

<p>Now, with such prospects you’ve got to wonder – what would fuel it?!</p>

<p>For every great economy to grow, at the pace that we are poised, you need a few things right:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a rule of law, that everyone respects</li>
  <li>a setup of governence that allows every voice heard – democrary, and</li>
  <li>most importantly, a working class that knows how to build stuff.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can’t do anything about the first 2. You can only do something around #3.</p>

<p>For engineering colleges, we have IITs – which do not come any top 100 list anywhere. For healthcare education, we have AIIMS – where no new things haven’t happened since ages. The list goes on. Point that I am trying to make is – we have no core research in our country. If I were to build something, with all my intellect, I’d work here. Some people call this – foundational models. But, I am not well-versed in any of this and so I can’t help here.</p>

<p>Second class is a good set of working class. Training for this working class is a joke. Only 34% of corporates in India provide internship programs. It’s an unoptimised industry that has very recently started gaining any traction. But, it’s still far away from bearing any fruits.</p>

<p>Third class is a set of artisian. People who come out of vocational studies – your plumbers, your electricians, your carpenters. I’m not going to bore you with the details (I don’t have them handy either) but my good ol’ product thinking and guessistimate tells me that this is an entirely unorganised industry where people get trained at job, often through referral – i.e. the gates are closed for any Joe who just wants to pick it up as a career choice.</p>

<p>At CareerMint, we are thinking of solving for #2 and have a vision to one day solve for #1 and #3.</p>

<p>We need a better way of helping the human resource of our country reach the maxima of their potential. In corporates and in work environments, across industries there exists a hidden ceiling that people can’t seem to crossover. Be it a nurse wanting to progress into a higher role or a IT guy at a services company trying for a better pay. It’s not that they are not skilled or don’t have the skill-set – they are just limited by a network and knowledge that let’s them try for something far above their weights.</p>

<p>We wish to solve this.</p>

<p>Through a mentorship space, through fellowships, apprenticeship programmes and a set of other minute innovations we wish to provide a platform for our college kids to get the best jobs and opportunities out there and then excel at them.</p>

<p>We are working on a pipe-dream here. There are a lot of uncertainities here. Some of which are at my end too. But, sitting down, knowing that this problem exists and not doing anything about is not the goal. If we don’t solve this, someone else will – and we welcome it. We just don’t want the next big thing to come out of any place other than India. [ Not saying that we don’t wish to operate in any other country or the ceil of aspirations and goals should be tied to the growth of a specific country, afterall our allegince is to intelligent life itself – humans or non-humans ]</p>

<p>We are open for insights, suggestions, partnershipsm and problem statements. The mission is more important than us.</p>

<p>In the end, I’ll leave you with this great poem that I often read when thinking about the “why” of what I want to do:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, ‘Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?’ Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won’t feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It’s not just in some of us; it’s in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.
(A Return to Love, by Marianne Williamson)[https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/928-our-deepest-fear-is-not-that-we-are-inadequate-our]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m very active on Twitter, more so in recent years but it has always stayed consistent compared to the other social medias whose seasons came and went. Twitter is a great platform to guage the “current thing” or to understand where the conversations are heading for the next two quarters. In the last 6 months, from Web3’s rise to it’s demise, FTX’s fiasco, OpenAI’s launch to it’s rise and conclusively the rise of the AI wave, the conversations around these were started and somewhat spearheaded on Twitter. It’s truly the “world’s townsquare” as Elon Musk puts it and I won’t disagree. It’s the intellectually densest community freely available for the people.</p>

<p>Anyway, there are two new trends that I’m seeing on the platfrom.</p>

<ol>
  <li>More tweets by an account <a href="https://twitter.com/stats_feed">World of Statistics</a>
</li>
  <li>More conversations around India and how it’s going to be the next big things.</li>
</ol>

<p>These ideas are also a drip-effect of the podcasts that I’m nowadays listening to.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ThePakistanExperience">“The Pakistan Experiece”</a> – some beautifully insighful guests sharing how and why the Pakistan economy is where it is today and how the internal disturbances and some recent policy changes led them to this crossroads.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWx7JXxm2xkTabER32I0GZg">“Barbershop by Shantanu”</a> – some beautiful insights from people who have created much of the digital space that we are aware of today.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>One of the articles that highlights it the best is Noah Smith’s <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/noahpinion/p/herecomesindia?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web">article</a> on India.</p>

<p>The crux of the above two insights is the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>India is the true and vaiable counter to the rising force of China.</li>
  <li>India has made some great leaps in transforming it’s internet usage (thanks to Jio) and bringing more people in the white economy (thanks for demonitisation).</li>
  <li>Exports »» Imports</li>
  <li>Political stability is very less/mis-understood and deeply underappreciated</li>
  <li>Some of our policies and it’s results are way ahead of any country out there. [UPI, Aadhaar, Startup India, Vande Bharat etc.]</li>
  <li>We are at a very good spot in terms of the stats. There’s very rarely a stat that looks bad for our country – other than Press Freedom.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here’s detailing all of them. All these assumptions and inputs are based on the insights and hard work done by the people who I’ve highlighted above. Please do follow them basis your taste.</p>

<ol>
  <li>India is the biggest population in the world and the population segregation is better than that of China.</li>
</ol>

<p>India has 1.4B people, some millions more than the Chinese. But, when it comes to population density, we have the median of our population in the 20s whereas the Chinese have it around ~40 years.</p>

<p>What this means that we have the biggest workforce for being an industrial nation.</p>

<p>Trade Deficit, the measure of how much imports are being done compared to exports in a country, stands at around USD 122.78 Billion for FY 2022-23. (Source)[https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1916220]. That is $122 B going out of our economy to international markets this past year. For any country to grow, they need to have a trade deficit in the positive and industrialisation beings that forth. We are a agriculture and services exports reliant country. For us to make the leap into the next</p>

<p>China is a closed economy. Their policies somewhat limit foreign investments and they are less open to the world – this is where India wins.</p>

<ol>
  <li>India has the biggest share of online payments. What this intails is that most of the transaction that is happening is in the white economy. This leads to better taxation and better measurement of the GDP. Only 5% of the Indian population pays taxes right now. This is majorly due to the parallel economy running right now. For instance, the cook <em>bhaiya</em> that cooks us food makes a very good income but he doesn’t pay taxes as no one is deducting TDS on his income.</li>
</ol>

<p>With better banking, and more robust taxation allows the govt. to have more money to spend of infrastructure,</p>

<ol>
  <li>More Indians are online. For good or bad, this means that there are more Indian voices online. We also have one of the biggest populations speaking English. Both these mean that when it comes to having dialogue, spread of ideas and of culture – we are the biggest by population after USA.</li>
</ol>

<p>Add to this that our values and beliefs are more aligned with the current superpower and the major market. We watch their shows and have a decent understanding of their traditions.</p>

<p>When this flips, (it always does) there is a greater possiblity that there will be more and more Indian content that will be spread around the world. This brings with itself the acceptance that any population needs to spread their influence. With acceptance, at a global scale, comes the positive outlook which leads to greater acceptance in trade, international relations, and easier access to tough discussions</p>

<ol>
  <li>Political stability is very less/mis-understood and deeply underappreciated.</li>
</ol>

<p>The current govt. for all it’s flaws has got it right with few of their policies. For all the hell that broke loose with demonitization, it did lead to us having the biggest volume of digital payments in the entire world – ahead of China too. This is a big deal which is often misunderstood and shrugged off as a natural progression of things. The RBI calls it the JAM Trinity. Done right, it</p>

<p>All in all, we are going to be big. We are 20 years behind China and our population is going to be young, in the range of 20-30 until 2070. If there has ever been a place to build wealth, it’s here.</p>

<p>But, for the country to be great, it needs to increase it’s exports. In order to increase our exports, we need to become a manufacturing mammoth rather than a agriculture based economy. Even today, in 2023, 54% of the total workforce in India are directly linked with agriculture. And, manufacturing only supports percent of our economy.</p>

<p>Imagine a mountain, on top of which rests a place that could give you in excess of whatever it is you desire. The only caveat being that there are a million steps between you and that place and it’ll take you a year long pilgrimage to the top. Thinking about this, for a goal-oriented person, I’m reminded of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoe_Dog">“The Shoe Dog”</a>– “The cowards never started, and the weak died on the way – that leaves us.”</p>

<p>But, let’s assume you decide on scaling it still, you are motivated enough and have your path clear in front of you.</p>

<p>The strong-willed will persist still (and may even climb another million steps), and those with fire in their bellies and an insatiable urge to prove themselves would endure the hardships but those are the selected few. Most people do not feel this about climbing steps, and there exists a simpler truth for them – like the act of walking. [ this needs to be better]</p>

<p>This is still a finite game scenario. Life is never a finite game. We all live finite lives but with infinite possibilities.</p>

<p>India is 15 year behind China. We are going to be a USD 30T economy by 2030 and will overtake China by 2075 – when I’m 80? Wow.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Product Thinking</p>

<h4 id="unique-intractions">Unique Intractions</h4>

<p>Retweets make Twitter unique
Tweets make Twitter unique
Posts and like made Facebook unique
Upvotes and comments make Reddit unique
Snapchat filters and text-on-image feature made them unique.</p>

<p>An app can’t just be a tool to post, it has to be a tool + some unique interactions.</p>

<p>How does one then segregate the crowd? Our platform is only for great teachers and very extraodinary students.</p>

<p>We remove noise when we make our product offerings very unique.</p>

<p>Through our app, a mentor interacts with or mentee.</p>

<p>It is not a social grapth. It is a social school.</p>

<p>Great talent needs proper nurturing.</p>

<p>Great nurturing requires great mentors.</p>

<p>Great mentors require great students and a way to transcend their knowledge.</p>

<p>Money is always the afterthought. It corrupts platforms when it enters a transaction.</p>

<p>We donot wush to create a transactional system.</p>

<p>Transactional interaction anyway encourage wrong/short-sighted behaviour. We are a century buidling company.</p>

<p>We are not here to build equity but build a framework for mordern mentorship.</p>

<p>Theil Fellowship for everyone. YC for every great student.</p>

<h4 id="status">Status</h4>

<p>People are more concerned about how they’re thought of than anything. If you are successful, there is a good chance that you have made enough money to make money your prime motivator.</p>

<p>After a certain stage in your career  – as a professional or a winner, you wish people to witness your greatness.</p>

<p>It is a narcissistic behaviour but it is what helps people do great stuff. We wish to catapult the same innate need-for-status for social good.</p>

<p>We can’t be that source of social status for sometime, hence, we’ll be the source to other social media platforms to build the same.</p>

<h4 id="gamification">Gamification</h4>

<p>When Quora was growing, I really liked using it. It was a great platfrom for people to ask strangers questions about their fields that only the real experts could answer.</p>

<p>All of that behaviour was led by a gamification system that resulted in very thoughtful and thought-through questions to be asked from the genisus of the world.</p>

<p>We wish to replicate the same.</p>

<p>Responders should be paid for their answers.</p>

<p>Question asking folks should have some means of generating enough cred to ask such questions.</p>

<p>And, there should be a way to get points, gift points, earn points etc.</p>

<p>– Gotta read Actionable Gamification.</p>
