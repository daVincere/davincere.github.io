It's the start of Sept. I'm 9 months into my second stint at the startup journey. 90% of my runway is gone (some investments came up) and I'm brimming with ideas and insights to build on.

[This Week in AI](https://thisweekinaiclub.substack.com) is growing well -- finally! Good week-on-week growth in both readership and subscription.  

[The AGI School](https://theagischool.com) is gaining recognition within my ICPs.  

And now, I'm emboldened to build a new brand for freelancing. For this I've chosen Substack and Twitter as the channels of growth.

All this while, I get ideas for two new apps:
1. Birthday Reminder App - still long on it. I believe no app exists that has become the go-to place for saving important dates for people.

2. Duolingo-like Language-learning app for learning Kannada.

By nature, I'm pragmatic and calculative. But it blinds me to believe that I'll be able to pull all these off with the "right kind of balance".

And looking at all the data that I have, I can too.

But here's the reality: I was nowhere near the milestones that I'd set for myself.

The website, the app, the endless blogs and newsletters, it was as if I was just doing things and the time was passing without any changes.

It was at a moment of deep honesty with myself that I finally understood -- I was not focused. I had too many things that I was trying to do and I wasn't getting anywhere with anything.

The realization came with a philosophical intervention: The way of doing less.

Doing less is not to say that you are a lazy buffoon but that you need to actively choose to do less and focus more on the care with which you ARE doing.

It's the timeless wisdom, understood across cultures and schools of thought.

The Japanese way of perfection. The 10000 hours principle. 99% perseverance rule. This and that, it's all the same.

Doing the same thing, for more time than you normally would, with unique experimentations results in evolution within those acts. 

Each evolution adds to the step-function of the act and allows for leaps to take place.

In the end of the entire cycle, it allows for compounding to happen.

This is the magic of focus -- and the result of the way of doing less.

Intentional, focused, deep psychological and spiritual devotion to a single act that it becomes THE edge.

Not "doing less" but actively choosing to do less -- for focussed efforts, allowing greatness to sprout.
