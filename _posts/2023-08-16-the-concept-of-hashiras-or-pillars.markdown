Why you should do everything, everyday.
---

It was a four-day weekend which was spent working on a B2C platform (mentioned in this [post](https://iamhasime.com/blog/2023/07/01/thecareermint_com.html)) towards the end of the last night, India's Independence Day, turned into a B2B one.  To discuss the validity of this new pivot I went on a call with a dear friend (Hello Jasmine!), one of the best bullshit filters that I have in my life. What will happen to this B2B idea, time will tell.

Anyway, towards the end of the call, I happened to share with her the concept of **_hashiras_**, something that I've already shared with a couple of folks and have now extrapolated enough times to write a blog on. People should do that often, saves them a bit of embarrassment.

To start, yes, I've stolen the word -- "Hashira" from the beautifully animated, a lil rushed but overall great anime : [Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_Slayer:_Kimetsu_no_Yaiba). If you haven't seen it, you definitely should.

With that off the way, here's what the concept of Hashira is -- **We all live multiple lives. Our mental stability, happiness, and contentment are mostly derived from the stability of these lives.**

Here's how you can think of it: imagine a wooden plane standing on top of wooden pillars. The plane represents the stability of our lives and each pillar represents a unique life that we have going on about ourselves. For some, it is work-life, for others a relationship and so on. The stability of the plane is completely dependent on the stability of the pillars it's standing on.

Most people mistake focusing on only 1 aspect of their lives -- only work, only pleasure, only XYZ thing. It takes up the shape of "hustle" or "true love" but it often is the only thing holding the stability of a person. But, often these pillars break, people are either laid-off, or not appreciated enough, or burn-out and down goes the entire stability-plane. The collapse of the old plane, and the absence of a new pillar to take care of it -- instantaneously -- results in the sadness phase of ours.

The alternative is to have more than 1, ideally, 5+ pillars to hold your mental sanity. If even one of them breaks or shows weakness, the others are there to safeguard against the fall. 

For me, these lives are:  
- my reading life 
- my work life 
- my being a good flatmate life
- my relationship -- with friends and family
- my side-hustle life
- my gym life
- my upskilling life

But once you have found these lives, you need to live them too. All of them, all at once. Growth in all is paramount. To allow for this, you need a structured timetable.

What's worked for me is dedicating each of these their timeslots which do not intermingle with each other. After waking up every day, I read a book for the first 1 hour. Post that, a gym session for an hour, and after that a work-life and so on. Nothing is non-important. Everything creates and elevates a certain part of my life.

All of these parallel lives complement each other and have long-term effects. All of these are infinite games in a finite structure (a day). The idea is to live an intentioned life. The idea is to have a framework where nothing of value, worth the investment is left to the future to take care of. 

Naval says -- "All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest." And nothing grows better than daily compounding.
