## what is? why, and why not?!
---
I was first introduced to the word **edelweiss** in a Youtube video from a channel called "History Buffs". History Buffs' creator Nik Hodges critiques historical movies for their accuracies and fiction -- in the process presenting a commentry on the history and culture of a movie. This [video was a review of the HBO mini-series The Band of Brother](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxv3s7xTYHU) and it made me watch one of the most beautifully created show of our times, but that's for another time.

Edelweiss is a flower that grows high up in the Alps. Due to it's growth in a somewhat arid and barren parts of the Alps it was romanticied to be a symbol of strength, beauty and bravery. Well before the Second World War, soldiers from the German army would climb the Alps in search of this flower and would wear it as a sign of honor -- to have made the tiring journey up the hill to get the same.

From this tradition, I draw the inspiration for what I call the Edelweiss Manifesto -- a set of goals/milestones that I'd set for myself to become worthy of the human race. I also call it the "The Umermensch Manifest"; but this doesn't have a mistique about it as does the Edelweiss. 

So, here are the milestones that I'd set for myself back in 2017. People say aim for the moon and you'll land somewhere in-between. But with this, I don't think moon was enen at the scope. Mars seemed like a better place to aim for me.Or maybe I had more confidence in my abilities back then. But for sure, I didn't know a lot of stuff and I used to think to myself -- "Ignorance is bliss, as long as you have a plan"

Anyway, here's the list:

- [x] 0. Earn to be able to struggle.
- [ ] 1. Make gitall.tech something.
- [ ] 2. Work on "dystanc" and find ways in which you can make it of value to others.
- [ ] 3. Buy a drone and try to implement some stuff to it. Basic patterns.
- [ ] 4. Start working on "dholu"; the voice assistant company.
- [ ] 5. Build a decentralised web company. 
- [ ] 6. Work on solving the issue of traffic.
- [ ] 7. Enter real-estate and construction in the field of public convenience.
- [ ] 8. Build the open-college: //some kick-ass name. 
- [ ] 9. Build a drone company.
- [ ] 10. Build a civil aviation cum transport company.
- [ ] 11. Die peacefully.

GitAll was going to be an ed-tech startup that'd solve the tech hiring problem.

Dystanc was going to solve hyper-local e-commerce.

Dholu was going to be a vernacular voice assistance company.

I was going to open an open-college -- a place that you can just come and learn whatever you wish to, hang around, and find "your" voice.

I was going to solve traffic and I was going to start a Zeppelin (Airship) based avaiation company.

I was going to all this because in college, at an age of 22, I had the confidence and a predestined hope that I was going to do all these things, I was infact destined for making this things come true. I had plans and I used to think about all these things -- during the mundane tasks of the day.

Then, college ended.

Still starry eyed, I had convinced my friends to take a punt with GitAll and make something of it. I think they stayed to be nice.

I made a lot of mistakes along the way, was blocked due to few mental blockers and tried ventures I had no belief in to ensure the survival of the Edelwiess Manifesto -- only to end up at a job.

I love my job, I get to work with one of the best engineers in the country, work under a co-founder from whom I can learn so much -- still.

But in this entire process, the confidence and the grit has died. I'm much more calculated, mallowed, machined human who understands the way of the world and it's secrets and I am not sure if I ever wanted to be this *bean counter* of a human. I don't have the same zeal that I had back in college. I guess this appetitie of having something of may own will die soon too. *Make money your god and it will plague you like a devil* -- right?

Anyway, nowadays, I'm plagued by the idea of building something of my own. All around I see opportunities that I can't just shut an eye to. I see people building stuff, doing wonderful stuff with their time and the prospect of taking scrum-calls and making incremental changes to a well-made B2B SaaS product doesn't resonate with me. This blog and this website is the first step in that direction. The Edelweiss Manifesto will change a bit. To account for the newly found worldly wisdom but it will remain.

So what's the Edelweiss Manifesto? It's a note to myself and the wild plans I had for myself. It's a love letter to myself from my past and a to-do from my future self that I will not live a wasteful life.

Ad Astra. Per Aspera. xoxo.
