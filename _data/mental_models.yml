   A community is a group of people who believe in the same thing, or care about the same problem and are chasing that journey together.  
   To make a community successful:
    1. Curate: Communities are about density. The denser the ambition and experience inside, the sharper the conversations. And density only comes from curation. Leave people who aren't the right fit for your community.
    2. Value Alignment: The values should be crystal clear. When values align, magic happens.
    3. Access: Have a way for people to access other people in the community without fluff.
