1. Build something that people want.
2. To build something that people want, understand how people behave and why they behave a certain way.
3. Consistent user interaction + scientific study is the way to understand user behaviour.
4. When building B2C businesses, never ignore 1 passionate voice. Your products become great through power users. It can often be painful but necessary to retain those power users.
5. When building mountains, let every grass leaf know how instrumental they are in holding it together -- because they are.
6. Honesty and humbleness -- this is what I often see in the approach taken by the co-founder of the current company that I work in. 
7. Understand that only exceptional behaviour stands out in today's world -- find that exceptional edge in everything.
8. Itâ€™s generally worth it to make short-term sacrifices to gain long-term trust.
