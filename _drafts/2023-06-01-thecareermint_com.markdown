India is 15 year behind China. We are going to be a USD 30T economy by 2030 and will overtake China by 2075 -- when I'm 80? Wow.

Product Thinking

#### Unique Intractions

Retweets make Twitter unique
Tweets make Twitter unique
Posts and like made Facebook unique
Upvotes and comments make Reddit unique
Snapchat filters and text-on-image feature made them unique.

An app can't just be a tool to post, it has to be a tool + some unique interactions.

How does one then segregate the crowd? Our platform is only for great teachers and very extraodinary students.

We remove noise when we make our product offerings very unique.

Through our app, a mentor interacts with or mentee.

It is not a social grapth. It is a social school.

Great talent needs proper nurturing.

Great nurturing requires great mentors.

Great mentors require great students and a way to transcend their knowledge.

Money is always the afterthought. It corrupts platforms when it enters a transaction.

We donot wush to create a transactional system.

Transactional interaction anyway encourage wrong/short-sighted behaviour. We are a century buidling company.

We are not here to build equity but build a framework for mordern mentorship.

Theil Fellowship for everyone. YC for every great student.


#### Status

People are more concerned about how they're thought of than anything. If you are successful, there is a good chance that you have made enough money to make money your prime motivator.

After a certain stage in your career  -- as a professional or a winner, you wish people to witness your greatness. 

It is a narcissistic behaviour but it is what helps people do great stuff. We wish to catapult the same innate need-for-status for social good.

We can't be that source of social status for sometime, hence, we'll be the source to other social media platforms to build the same.

#### Gamification

When Quora was growing, I really liked using it. It was a great platfrom for people to ask strangers questions about their fields that only the real experts could answer.

All of that behaviour was led by a gamification system that resulted in very thoughtful and thought-through questions to be asked from the genisus of the world.

We wish to replicate the same.

Responders should be paid for their answers.

Question asking folks should have some means of generating enough cred to ask such questions.

And, there should be a way to get points, gift points, earn points etc.
