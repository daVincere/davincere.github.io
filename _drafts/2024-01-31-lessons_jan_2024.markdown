2024 will be the year. The year when the current deficit running between the new year resolutions and what happens gets reduced. I've figured out the missing part afterall -- focus and discipline.

Focus is saying no to things -- as much as you can.

Discipline is saying no to easy -- as much as you can.

In light of being disciplined, here's a last ditch effort to put out a blog post on Jan, on the last day of the month at 2:28 AM. :facepalm:

So, things I learnt in Jan 2024:

1. [The Missing Tile Syndrome](https://assets.ctfassets.net/qnesrjodfi80/1SubvPLxCoeImGSwsWE6Iw/999a8da9494c10548c2fd165438668e7/prager-the_missing_tile_syndrome-transcript.pdf)

Coined by Dennis Prager, it talks about how we focus on the missing bits in things rather than focus on the whole part that we have.

We play tricks on ourselves and undermine our happiness; by concentrating on the missing tiles every one of us has.

To a large extent, the answer to that question will determine how happy you will be.

2. [Freudian Slip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freudian_slip)

3. Understand don't judge.

4. Good study is when you understand both ends of the argument.


3. Doubt can only be replaced with action. [ Ted Lasso S03E01]


4. You can't let yesterday get in the way of today.
