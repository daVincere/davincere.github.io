## India is going be the next big superpower -- how are you dealing your cards.
---
I'm very active on Twitter, more so in recent years but it has always stayed consistent compared to the other social medias whose seasons came and went. Twitter is a great platform to guage the "current thing" or to understand where the conversations are heading for the next two quarters. In the last 6 months, from Web3's rise to it's demise, FTX's fiasco, OpenAI's launch to it's rise and conclusively the rise of the AI wave, the conversations around these were started and somewhat spearheaded on Twitter. It's truly the "world's townsquare" as Elon Musk puts it and I won't disagree. It's the intellectually densest community freely available for the people.

Anyway, there are two new trends that I'm seeing on the platfrom. 

1. More tweets by an account [World of Statistics](https://twitter.com/stats_feed)
2. More conversations around India and how it's going to be the next big things.

These ideas are also a drip-effect of the podcasts that I'm nowadays listening to. 
1. ["The Pakistan Experiece"](https://www.youtube.com/@ThePakistanExperience) -- some beautifully insighful guests sharing how and why the Pakistan economy is where it is today and how the internal disturbances and some recent policy changes led them to this crossroads.

2. ["Barbershop by Shantanu"](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWx7JXxm2xkTabER32I0GZg) -- some beautiful insights from people who have created much of the digital space that we are aware of today.

One of the articles that highlights it the best is Noah Smith's [article](https://open.substack.com/pub/noahpinion/p/herecomesindia?utm_source=direct&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web) on India.

The crux of the above two insights is the following:

1. India is the true and vaiable counter to the rising force of China.
2. India has made some great leaps in transforming it's internet usage (thanks to Jio) and bringing more people in the white economy (thanks for demonitisation).
3. Exports >>>> Imports
4. Political stability is very less/mis-understood and deeply underappreciated
5. Some of our policies and it's results are way ahead of any country out there. [UPI, Aadhaar, Startup India, Vande Bharat etc.]
6. We are at a very good spot in terms of the stats. There's very rarely a stat that looks bad for our country -- other than Press Freedom.

Here's detailing all of them. All these assumptions and inputs are based on the insights and hard work done by the people who I've highlighted above. Please do follow them basis your taste.

1. India is the biggest population in the world and the population segregation is better than that of China.

India has 1.4B people, some millions more than the Chinese. But, when it comes to population density, we have the median of our population in the 20s whereas the Chinese have it around ~40 years.

What this means that we have the biggest workforce for being an industrial nation. 

Trade Deficit, the measure of how much imports are being done compared to exports in a country, stands at around USD 122.78 Billion for FY 2022-23. (Source)[https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1916220]. That is $122 B going out of our economy to international markets this past year. For any country to grow, they need to have a trade deficit in the positive and industrialisation beings that forth. We are a agriculture and services exports reliant country. For us to make the leap into the next 

China is a closed economy. Their policies somewhat limit foreign investments and they are less open to the world -- this is where India wins. 

2. India has the biggest share of online payments. What this intails is that most of the transaction that is happening is in the white economy. This leads to better taxation and better measurement of the GDP. Only 5% of the Indian population pays taxes right now. This is majorly due to the parallel economy running right now. For instance, the cook *bhaiya* that cooks us food makes a very good income but he doesn't pay taxes as no one is deducting TDS on his income. 

With better banking, and more robust taxation allows the govt. to have more money to spend of infrastructure, 

3. More Indians are online. For good or bad, this means that there are more Indian voices online. We also have one of the biggest populations speaking English. Both these mean that when it comes to having dialogue, spread of ideas and of culture -- we are the biggest by population after USA. 

Add to this that our values and beliefs are more aligned with the current superpower and the major market. We watch their shows and have a decent understanding of their traditions. 

When this flips, (it always does) there is a greater possiblity that there will be more and more Indian content that will be spread around the world. This brings with itself the acceptance that any population needs to spread their influence. With acceptance, at a global scale, comes the positive outlook which leads to greater acceptance in trade, international relations, and easier access to tough discussions

4. Political stability is very less/mis-understood and deeply underappreciated. 

The current govt. for all it's flaws has got it right with few of their policies. For all the hell that broke loose with demonitization, it did lead to us having the biggest volume of digital payments in the entire world -- ahead of China too. This is a big deal which is often misunderstood and shrugged off as a natural progression of things. The RBI calls it the JAM Trinity. Done right, it 


All in all, we are going to be big. We are 20 years behind China and our population is going to be young, in the range of 20-30 until 2070. If there has ever been a place to build wealth, it's here.

But, for the country to be great, it needs to increase it's exports. In order to increase our exports, we need to become a manufacturing mammoth rather than a agriculture based economy. Even today, in 2023, 54% of the total workforce in India are directly linked with agriculture. And, manufacturing only supports percent of our economy. 




Imagine a mountain, on top of which rests a place that could give you in excess of whatever it is you desire. The only caveat being that there are a million steps between you and that place and it'll take you a year long pilgrimage to the top. Thinking about this, for a goal-oriented person, I'm reminded of ["The Shoe Dog"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoe_Dog)-- "The cowards never started, and the weak died on the way -- that leaves us." 

But, let's assume you decide on scaling it still, you are motivated enough and have your path clear in front of you. 

The strong-willed will persist still (and may even climb another million steps), and those with fire in their bellies and an insatiable urge to prove themselves would endure the hardships but those are the selected few. Most people do not feel this about climbing steps, and there exists a simpler truth for them -- like the act of walking. [ this needs to be better]

This is still a finite game scenario. Life is never a finite game. We all live finite lives but with infinite possibilities.
