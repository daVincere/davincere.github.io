## Playing infinite game in a finite world.

Growing up, being a defense kid (*an army brat*), I always wanted to become an Indian Army Officer. The sense of patrotism, contributing to the country at the highest and the most endeared level filled me with a sense of purpose in life. It was almost the only thing I prepared for all my school life since I could think for myself. But after failing in my maiden [SSB exam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Services_Selection_Board), and on contemplation, realising that I might not possess all the OLQs, I decided to not sit for the next SSB exam. For the first time since I could think for myself  I had nothing to go after. In the absense of a direction, like everyone, I decided to go with the flow and decided to become an engineer. It had less to do with what other were doing around me but with the fact that I had always been a builder.

I've always liked building *things*. Doesn't matter tech, non-tech, a painting or a mural out of clay. I've always liked being part of a discipline, a learning structure where with rigorous study I could become better at things. I was a very dedicated clay modeller, mural-artist, martial-artist (Taekwon-do), and a NCC cadet. 

All of this carried forward when I entered college. Saddened by my bad results in 12th Boards, I'd decided to not waste time in college and on the very first day approached the best rankers of my class to create a club with them. It didn't work out well. Infact, the next 12 iterations of it didn't work. With each iteration I got better at creating teams, approaching people, pitching my ideas to strangers and sharing a vision. Finally, on the 14th attempt I created a *team* with 4 folks and named it **Team ING** 

The idea was simple -- learn the craft on the sides so that we build something by the end of the college. I was inspired by the entrepreneurial stories of Flipkart and Facebook -- both of which a fad at that time. Since the first year of college [2014] I've wanted to build something of my own. There have been multiple interations and attempts but none have succeeded. 

Even now, I want to build something. The thought of "not having my own company" is a 

Chef's Table: Pizza happens to be one of the most layered shows that I've watched in my recent memory. It's up there with Everything Everywhere All at Once, and TheWhale -- other rich pieces of entertainment that I've watched.

Anyway, there's an episode on the show, about Yoshihiro Imai, a pizza chef based off of Kyoto Japan who found the purpose of his life to be the path of making pizza that inspires people.
