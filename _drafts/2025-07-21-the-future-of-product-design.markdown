UI/UX Design will be dead in 5 years.

I was at a house-party-turned-design-conference yesterday. (Thanks for the invite Bhagat Singh )

All my conversations with designers led to the same conclusion -- design is a white-collar mental grind and will be replaced with AI. 

With the rise of tools like ChatGPT Agents, the need for traditional UI/UX roles could quickly become obsolete.

Why?

Because the primary mode of interaction is shifting -- from humans navigating interfaces, to AI agents crawling the internet.

You need to book a flight? 

An agent would choose between the aggregators, airlines and what not and get you the cheapest price possible -- without the hassle of you looking into 10s of interfaces.

As the agent usage grows, platforms themselves will start optimizing for agentic interactions instead of human ones. 

And this kind of shift isnâ€™t new.

All this has happened in the past too. 

There have been jobs in history, with sophistication and high-creativity that vanished as the mode of primary interaction with machines changed.

Typesetters. Typographers. Mural Painters. 

All these jobs existed for over a century and as the primary mode of interaction changed, they stopped existing.

As these "jobs" change, the creativity will be directed elsewhere.

Maybe physical art will make a comeback. 

Maybe cities will feel more human and inviting again.

Maybe homes will stop being filled with mass-produced industrial decor.

And maybe -- just maybe -- artists will go back to creating art about other humans :)
